<h2>Sending mail to site
    participants via Email Archive</h2>
<p>To send an email to every member of your course or <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">project site</a>, follow
these steps:</p>

<ol><li>In the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a> of your course or project site, click
<strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong>. If you don't see Email Archive, the site
leader (or someone with the proper permissions) must add it to the
site; for instructions see <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardl">Adding Email Archive to your site</a>.<br /><br />
</li><li>On the Email Archive screen, under "Email sent to the following
addresses will be archived and sent to participants", you'll see the
site email address. Above it, you'll also see the email address from
which you are authorized to send email; use this account to send
messages to the site address. Messages will go to <strong>all</strong>
participants in your course or project site, plus get archived online
in the Email Archive.
</li></ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot use Email Archive to send
messages to particular individuals. Messages sent to your site's email
address are received by all site participants.</p>
