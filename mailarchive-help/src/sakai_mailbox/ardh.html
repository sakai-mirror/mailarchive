<h2>Email Archive: Overview</h2>
<h3>What it does</h3>

<p>Each site has an automatically generated site email address, which you
can view via the Email Archive tool. Email you send to the site email
address is copied to all site participants and owners.</p>

<p>All messages sent to your site's email address are stored in the Email
Archive. Each message sent to site participants will indicate if
there is an attachment, and provide a link to get the attachment
from the worksite itself.</p>

<p>Site members can use Preferences in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a> to choose
how often they want to receive email sent to the site's email address;
see <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzv">Changing notification preferences</a>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Mail Alias:</strong> Site owners can create an
easy-to-remember alias for the site's email address. To set up the
alias, from within the Email Archive, click <strong><code>Options...Â </code></strong>.</p>



<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>Use Email Archive to mail all site participants at once. You
cannot use it to send mail to an individual or a group within the
site. To send messages to an individual or a group, use the Messages
tool instead; see <a href="content.hlp?docId=augw">Sending and replying to messages</a>.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Users who participate in more than one site can choose to receive
email either as it is sent, or in digest mode, with all posts for the
day sent in a single email message.  <br /><br />
</li><li>Participants can use any email program to send messages to the
email address listed at the top of your Email Archive page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Clicking a column header (<strong><code>From</code></strong>, <strong><code>Subject</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Sent</code></strong>) will sort the messages by that header.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When sorting by subject, clicking the up arrow will arrange the
messages alphabetically. When sorting by date received, clicking the
up arrow will order the messages from most recent to oldest. In both
cases, clicking the down arrow reverses the order.  <br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses plain text to format messages, even if
their original format was HTML or rich text. Site participants can
view a message in its original format by clicking the link provided in
the Email Archive.
<br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses links to handle attachments. Instead of
receiving an attachment directly in the body of an email message, site
participants can click a link to view the attachment. This feature
helps prevent site participants from going over quota.</li></ul>
