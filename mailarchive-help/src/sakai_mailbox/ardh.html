<h2>Email Archive: Overview</h2>

<h3>What it does</h3>
<p>Each site has an automatically generated site email address, which you
can view in the <strong><code>Email Archive</code></strong> feature. Email sent to the site
email address is copied to all site participants and owners.</p>

<p>All messages sent to your site's email address are stored in the Email
Archive. Each message sent to site participants will indicate if
there is an attachment, and provide a link to get the attachment
from the worksite itself.</p>

<p>Members of the group can choose how often they want to receive email
sent to the site's email address in the <strong><code>Preferences</code></strong> feature
in <a href="content.hlp?docId=aqzy">My Workspace</a>.</p>

<h3>Key concepts</h3>

<p><strong>Mail Alias:</strong> Site owners can create an
easy-to-remember alias for the site's email address. To set up the
alias, from within the Email Archive, click <strong><code>Options...Â </code></strong>.</p>



<h3>Things to consider</h3>
<ul><li>Instructors can use Email Archive to automatically update email
groups for <a href="content.hlp?docId=ardt">course sites</a>. As students drop or add the course, they will
automatically be dropped or added from the email group.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Users who participate in more than one site can choose to
receive email either as it is sent, or in digest mode, with all posts
for the day sent in a single email message.
<br /><br />
</li><li>Messages can be sent from any email program
to the email address listed at the top of your Email Archive page.

<br /><br />
</li><li>Clicking a column header (<strong><code>From</code></strong>, <strong><code>Subject</code></strong>, or
<strong><code>Sent</code></strong>) will sort the messages by that header.

<br /><br />
</li><li>When sorting by subject, clicking the up arrow will arrange the
messages alphabetically. When sorting by date received, clicking the
up arrow will order the messages from most recent to oldest. In both
cases, clicking the down arrow reverses the order.
<br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses plain text to format messages, even if
their original format was HTML or rich text. Site participants can
view a message in its original format by clicking the link provided in
the Email Archive.
<br /><br />
</li><li>The Email Archive uses links to handle attachments. Instead of
receiving an attachment directly in the body of an email message, site
participants can click a link to view the attachment. This feature
helps prevent site participants from going over quota.</li></ul>
