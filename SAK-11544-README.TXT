This is my work in progress for improving the performance of 
the Mail Archive tool.

To make this work - you also need the code from message in a branch
for this SAK.

You will also notice that I have a number of BaseDbDouble
files here - this is so the modifications I made to the DbDouble 
code can be kept separate for earlier versions of Sakai.

Once this tests out, I will move these mdifications 
back into the db module.
